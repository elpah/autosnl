// car type. This is general car data

// advanced search type.
// - so basically here also includes some comoponents of the
// car data but i will have other fields example a range of car prices. that could be example
// setting a min price, and max price.
// and also an array of car models. lets say for toyota, we may want to seacch for corolla and rav4 at the same
//time

// for search result, we only need 2 fields for now. that is car brand and model
