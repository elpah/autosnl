After setting up React Context in my React frontend of my Fullstack app , the next step was to make use of it  across my components.

 I began by importing the context into the components where I needed to access the global state in this case my app component.

I then initialized the local states for things like advancedSearchFieldDataâ€”data that needs to be shared across the app.

then i  wrapped my entire component tree with GlobalContext.Provider, which allowed me to make  advancedSearchFieldData state accessible to any child component.

 passing the global state and setter functions down the component tree, I simplified state management across my entire app.

The next step? Integrating more complex state interactions to ensure real-time updates across the app.
